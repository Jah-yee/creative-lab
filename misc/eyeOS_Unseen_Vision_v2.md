# PHILOSOPHY

This is not a brand film. This is a piece of cinema that happens to end with a logo.

The previous draft failed because it tried to be clever — stacking "eye" metaphors like a philosophy lecture. That's advertising logic, not art. An art piece doesn't explain itself. It leaves residue.

**The new approach:** Build around the music. The whitneytbh cover of "All My Friends" has a specific emotional architecture in its first 17 seconds — a slow, aching vocal entry over stripped-back production, building into the first line of the hook. The film rides this wave. Every cut syncs to the music's breath, not to a narrative outline.

**What this film IS:**
A montage of fragments. Disconnected, beautiful, slightly wrong. Like memories from a life you didn't live. The images accumulate feeling the way dreams accumulate meaning — not through logic, but through proximity and rhythm. And then, in the last two seconds, a face appears, and everything before it rearranges in your mind.

**What this film is NOT:**
- Not a product demo
- Not a "journey" or "arc"
- Not explained by text
- Not in Chinese
- No voiceover. No titles until the endcard. No narration.

**Audience:** International. Art-literate. The kind of person who knows A24 films, follows Magnum Photos on Instagram, has a Letterboxd account. Someone who would watch a Tarkovsky long take and feel something rather than get bored.

# VISUAL LANGUAGE — Unified across all shots

## The Rulebook

**Film Stock Simulation:** Every frame must feel like it was shot on Kodak Vision3 250D or Fuji Eterna Vivid 500. No digital sharpness. Ever. If a frame looks "clean," it's wrong.

**Color System (strict):**
- Primary: Desaturated earth — ochre, slate, driftwood
- Accent: eyeOS purple (#7B50C2) appears as ORGANIC surprises — the iridescence of a beetle's shell, a twilight sky reflected in water, a piece of fabric, a wildflower. Never as a filter. Never as a designed element until the endcard. It should feel found, not placed.
- Forbidden: Saturated primaries. Digital teal-and-orange. Anything that looks color-graded rather than photographed.

**Texture:** Heavy grain. Not Instagram grain — actual celluloid texture. Slight halation on highlights. Gentle breathing in exposure (as if the camera's auto-iris is slowly reacting to light changes).

**Composition:** Influenced by — not imitating — three directors:
- **Tarkovsky:** Time pressure. Water. Decay. Extreme patience with the frame.
- **Kurosawa:** Dynamic stillness. Weather as character. Grey-scale tonal mastery.
- **Terrence Malick:** Stolen moments. Natural light only. Hands, grass, skin, sky. The camera as a curious child.

**Aspect Ratio:** 2.39:1 (Cinemascope). Letterboxed black bars.

**Movement:** Handheld but controlled. The camera breathes. It never "tracks" or "dollies" — it drifts, like a person turning their head.

# SHOT-BY-SHOT STORYBOARD

*Timecodes approximate — final timing driven by music edit points.*

---

## 01 — WATER SURFACE
**Time:** 0:00 – 0:02
**Music moment:** Silence before vocal entry. First piano notes.

**Frame:** Overhead shot looking straight down at dark water. Almost black, but in the surface you see the faintest reflection — clouds, or maybe a building, or maybe nothing at all. A single ripple expands slowly from a point just off-center. The ripple distorts whatever reflection exists. Purple-blue iridescence shimmers on the water surface for a half-second — like an oil slick, or like light from somewhere unseen.

**What it means (never stated):** Water = the world as a visually impaired person might experience it. You sense shapes, you sense movement, but clarity is always dissolving. Also: the ripple is a signal going out, like sonar, like echolocation, like the pendant's LiDAR pulse.

**Camera:** Static overhead. No movement except the water itself.

**Transition:** Hard cut on the first beat of music.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
Overhead bird's-eye view looking straight down at dark still water surface, near-black with subtle cloud reflections barely visible, a single expanding ripple ring from off-center point distorting the reflections. Faint purple-blue oil-slick iridescence catching light on water surface. Shot on 35mm Kodak Vision3 250D, heavy film grain, slight halation on brightest reflection points. Earth-tone palette with muted purple shimmer as only color accent. Tarkovsky-inspired water meditation, extreme stillness, contemplative, no objects in frame except water surface and its reflections. Cinematic 2.39:1 anamorphic. --ar 21:9 --s 800 --style raw
```

### Video Generation Prompt
```
Perfectly still overhead shot of dark water. Single ripple ring slowly expands outward from off-center point. Water surface iridescence shifts between purple and teal as ripple passes through. No camera movement. Extremely slow pace. Film grain texture, 24fps. Duration 2 seconds.
```

## 02 — SPHINX AT DAWN
**Time:** 0:02 – 0:03.5
**Music moment:** Vocal begins — "Now all my friends..."

**Frame:** The Great Sphinx of Giza in pre-dawn blue light — but not the tourist postcard. We see it from behind and to the side, a vantage point that most people never photograph. The Sphinx's eroded face is partly in shadow. The sky behind it is the deep violet-blue of the last moment before sunrise. The stone surface is textured like skin — millennia of wind erosion have given it an almost organic quality, like it's breathing. Dust particles float in the air, catching pre-dawn light.

A thin purple band on the horizon where the sky meets the desert — the moment before the sun breaks. This is the eyeOS purple, but it belongs to the sky, not to the brand.

**What it means:** The Sphinx has watched for 4,500 years. It has seen everything. And its face is half-eroded — vision is impermanent. Even stone loses its eyes.

**Camera:** Static or imperceptibly slow pan right. The Sphinx occupies the left third. Sky dominates.

**Transition:** Whip-cut (fast) to Shot 03 — the velocity contrast creates energy.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
The Great Sphinx of Giza photographed from behind and slightly to the right, unusual rear three-quarter angle showing eroded stone surface texture like aged skin. Pre-dawn deep violet-blue sky, thin purple-magenta band along horizon where sky meets desert. Floating dust particles catching early light. Stone texture extremely detailed showing millennia of wind erosion, organic weathered surface. No tourists, no modern elements visible. Shot on 35mm Fuji Eterna Vivid 500, visible film grain, muted earth tones with deep blue-violet sky. Sphinx occupies left third of frame, vast sky dominates. Tarkovsky-meets-Lean epic scale with intimate texture detail. Anamorphic 2.39:1. --ar 21:9 --s 750 --style raw
```

### Video Generation Prompt
```
Near-static wide shot of Sphinx from rear angle. Imperceptibly slow rightward drift of camera. Dust particles float through frame catching light. Thin line of purple dawn light on horizon slowly brightens by 10%. Stone texture feels alive in shifting pre-dawn light. 24fps, heavy film grain, 1.5 seconds. Hard cut at end.
```

## 03 — FLASH: US DOLLAR EYE
**Time:** 0:03.5 – 0:04
**Music moment:** On beat — "...are wasted"

**Frame:** FAST. Half a second. Extreme macro of the Eye of Providence on the US one-dollar bill — but this is a bill that has been through a lifetime. Worn soft, creased, stained. The engraving lines are still hypnotically precise under macro, but the paper around them is falling apart. Strong raking sidelight. Green ink reads as olive-grey in the desaturated palette.

**What it means:** Flash frame = subliminal. The "all-seeing eye" as global power symbol. Flashes by so fast it's more feeling than seeing — which is the point.

**Camera:** Static macro. 0.5 seconds. Arrives and leaves like a blink.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
Extreme macro of Eye of Providence on heavily worn US one-dollar bill, engraving lines crisp under magnification but surrounding paper creased and coffee-stained. Strong raking light from right revealing ink relief as micro-topography. Desaturated olive-grey palette, no bright green. Paper fiber texture visible. 35mm macro, Kodak film grain, shallow depth of field with only central eye detail sharp. Clinical, documentary, beautiful. 2.39:1 crop. --ar 21:9 --s 500 --style raw
```

### Video Generation Prompt
```
Static macro. Light subtly shifts across dollar bill surface over 0.5 seconds revealing texture. No camera movement. Extremely brief — designed as flash cut. Film grain, 24fps.
```

## 04 — HANDS IN TALL GRASS
**Time:** 0:04 – 0:06
**Music moment:** "...and I hate this club..."

**Frame:** A pair of hands — not doing anything purposeful — trailing through tall wild grass in golden hour light. We see only the hands and forearms entering from the bottom of frame, fingers spread, grass blades bending and springing back. The grass is backlit, each blade outlined in warm light. There's a Malick-like ecstasy to this — the pure sensory pleasure of touch. One of the hands wears a thin woven bracelet with a single purple thread woven in (almost invisible — the "found" purple accent).

The hands move slowly, deliberately. Like someone learning the shape of the world through fingertips.

**What it means:** Touch as perception. The body as antenna. A visual person walks through a field and sees it; this person walks through and *feels* it. Neither experience is lesser.

**Camera:** Handheld, following the hands. Slight vertical breathing. Backlit golden hour.

**Transition:** The grass blades fill the frame → dissolve into the vertical lines of Shot 05.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
Two hands with spread fingers trailing through tall wild grass, entering frame from bottom, backlit by golden hour sunlight outlining each grass blade in warm amber. Hands moving slowly through grass with deliberate sensory purpose. One wrist has a thin woven bracelet with barely visible purple thread. Terrence Malick-style stolen moment, natural light only, shallow depth of field, background blown to warm abstract glow. 35mm Kodak Vision3 500T film, heavy grain, handheld slight motion feel, anamorphic bokeh. Earth tones with golden backlight, no digital clarity. Intimate, tactile, joyful. 2.39:1. --ar 21:9 --s 750 --style raw
```

### Video Generation Prompt
```
Handheld shot tracking alongside hands moving through tall grass. Fingers spread wide, grass blades bend and spring back. Golden backlight creates halo around each blade. Camera breathes vertically with gentle handheld sway. Slow, sensual pace. 24fps, film grain, anamorphic flare from backlight. Duration 2 seconds. Dissolve transition at end.
```

---

## 05 — RAIN ON A WINDOW / CITY BEYOND
**Time:** 0:06 – 0:07.5
**Music moment:** "...man I drink too much..."

**Frame:** Interior looking out through a rain-covered window. The city beyond is abstract — just shapes of light, neon blurs, moving headlights that smear into streaks through the water. We can't identify any specific city; it could be Tokyo, London, São Paulo. The window glass itself is the subject — each raindrop is a tiny lens that contains a distorted, inverted image of the city. Between the droplets, the glass has condensation breath-fog that someone has drawn a small circle in with their finger — a cleared patch revealing sharper city lights through it, like a portal. The cleared circle echoes the pendant's camera lens.

Warm tungsten interior light spills from lower left. Cool blue-violet city light from outside. The color temperature clash creates a Wong Kar-wai compression.

**What it means:** The rain-blurred city = the world as experienced without full vision. The finger-drawn circle = technology (the pendant) clearing a small window of perception. But the blurred version is beautiful too.

**Camera:** Static. Rain moves. Light moves. Frame doesn't.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
Interior view looking through rain-covered window at night city, city lights reduced to abstract bokeh blurs and neon smears through water droplets. Each raindrop acts as tiny lens containing inverted city image. Condensation fog on glass with a small circle wiped clear by finger, revealing sharper city lights through the cleared patch. Warm tungsten light spilling from lower left interior, cool blue-violet city light from outside creating color temperature clash. Wong Kar-wai intimate window framing, 35mm Kodak film, heavy grain, anamorphic lens, no identifiable city landmarks. Abstract, melancholic, beautiful. 2.39:1. --ar 21:9 --s 700 --style raw
```

### Video Generation Prompt
```
Static interior shot through rain-covered window. Raindrops slowly slide down glass surface. City lights beyond shift and pulse as traffic moves. Light refracts through each droplet creating moving micro-images. Condensation slowly creeps around the cleared circle on glass. No camera movement, all movement in the world beyond the glass. Film grain, 24fps. Duration 1.5 seconds.
```

## 06 — FLASH: VINYL SPINNING
**Time:** 0:07.5 – 0:08
**Music moment:** On a beat transition

**Frame:** Another flash cut — 0.5 seconds. Overhead view of a vinyl record spinning on a turntable. The grooves catch light in concentric circles. The label is illegible, worn. There's a quality of hypnosis to the spiral — the same geometric pull as the water ripple from Shot 01 (callback). Motion blur from the rotation.

**What it means:** Sound as an alternative sense-world. Music as the universal accessibility feature. Also: the circle motif continues.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
Overhead view of vinyl record spinning on minimalist turntable, grooves catching light in concentric circles, worn illegible label. Rotational motion blur visible in the vinyl surface reflections. Warm ambient light from one side creating crescent of highlight across grooves. Braun/Rams-inspired turntable design visible at edges. 35mm film, desaturated earth tones, heavy grain. The spiral grooves echo water ripple patterns. Meditative, hypnotic. 2.39:1 crop. --ar 21:9 --s 600 --style raw
```

### Video Generation Prompt
```
Overhead shot of vinyl spinning at 33rpm. Grooves catch and release light as record rotates. Slight wobble in the vinyl surface. Stylus arm visible at edge of frame. 0.5 second flash cut duration. Film grain, warm light. 24fps.
```

## 07 — JAPANESE SCHOOL CORRIDOR
**Time:** 0:08 – 0:10.5
**Music moment:** Building into second phrase

**Frame:** Long shot down a Japanese high school corridor. Afternoon sun pours through windows on the left, casting geometric light patterns across polished wood floor. A single figure in school uniform stands at the far end — NOT walking, just standing, facing away from camera, silhouetted against the bright end of the corridor. Perfectly still. The curtains breathe slowly in wind. Dust motes float through the light beams.

The figure's posture has a particular quality — relaxed, patient, unhurried. Their right hand rests at their side holding what might be a white cane, but it's too far away and too backlit to be certain. This ambiguity is intentional. You notice it only if you look.

A small purple wildflower sits in a glass of water on the windowsill in the foreground — the "found" purple accent.

**What it means:** Youth. Patience. The specific beauty of being still while the world moves around you. The Japanese high school setting carries its own cinematic weight — Miyazaki, Koreeda, Shinkai — without needing to reference them explicitly. The corridor as liminal space: between childhood and adulthood, between one way of perceiving and another.

**Camera:** Kubrick-locked symmetrical one-point perspective. Dead center. Low angle. Absolutely static. All movement is environmental — curtains, dust, light shifting.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
Long symmetrical one-point perspective down Japanese high school corridor, polished wooden floor, white walls, large windows on left side casting geometric afternoon sunlight patterns across floor. Single figure in dark school uniform standing completely still at far end of corridor, backlit silhouette, facing away from camera. Figure's right hand at their side holding a thin vertical object, ambiguous in backlight. White curtains billowing gently from breeze. Dust motes floating through sun beams. Small glass of water with single purple wildflower on near windowsill in foreground. Kubrick-style locked symmetrical composition, low horizontal camera angle, one-point perspective vanishing point on the figure. Shot on 35mm Kodak Tri-X, deep depth of field, heavy film grain, Kurosawa grey-scale tonal system with figure in mid-grey silhouette against blown bright corridor end. Nostalgic, patient, beautiful. 2.39:1 anamorphic. --ar 21:9 --s 800 --style raw
```

### Video Generation Prompt
```
Locked symmetrical static shot down school corridor. Figure at far end stands completely motionless. Curtains billow slowly from window breeze. Dust particles drift through geometric sun beams on polished floor. Light patterns shift imperceptibly as clouds pass. Small foreground flower catches slight breeze. Figure remains perfectly still throughout — person still, scene dynamic. 35mm grain, 24fps. Duration 2.5 seconds.
```

## 08 — FINGERTIPS ON BRAILLE (EXTREME CLOSE-UP)
**Time:** 0:10.5 – 0:12
**Music moment:** Vocal sustain

**Frame:** Extreme macro — a single fingertip pressing into a Braille page. We're so close we can see the fingerprint ridges compressing against the raised dots. The light is clinical, beautiful — low-angle raking light that turns each Braille dot into a tiny planet casting a long shadow. The paper has a warm cream tone. The skin has a living luminosity.

This is the tactile equivalent of reading — intimate, physical, slow. The finger moves almost imperceptibly across the dots, left to right.

**What it means:** Another way of seeing. Reading with your body. The Braille dots echo every circular motif so far — water ripple, Sphinx pupil, dollar eye, vinyl grooves, pendant lens — they're all the same shape because perception is perception, regardless of the sense organ.

**Camera:** Macro. Extremely slow rightward tracking following the fingertip.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
Extreme macro close-up of single fingertip pressing against raised Braille dots on warm cream paper. Fingerprint ridges visible compressing against dot surfaces. Low-angle raking light from left casting long elegant shadows from each Braille dot. Paper fiber texture and skin texture both visible at micro level, subtle moisture sheen on skin. 100mm macro lens, 35mm film stock, shallow depth of field with only the contact point between finger and dots in sharp focus. Warm cream and skin tones, clinical but intimate lighting. Kurosawa-influenced tonal range: mid-greys dominate, no pure black or white. Film grain visible. 2.39:1. --ar 21:9 --s 650 --style raw
```

### Video Generation Prompt
```
Ultra-slow macro tracking shot following fingertip moving right across Braille page. Finger advances at reading pace, pressing each dot. Raking sidelight creates shifting shadow patterns as finger moves. Extremely intimate scale — fingertip fills frame. Film grain, 24fps. Duration 1.5 seconds.
```

## 09 — THE PENDANT (BRIEF)
**Time:** 0:12 – 0:13
**Music moment:** Breath between phrases

**Frame:** 1 second. Medium close-up of a person's chest — simple white t-shirt fabric. The eyeOS pendant hangs at sternum level on a thin cord. Natural light from camera-left. The pendant's purple LED blinks once — a quick, quiet pulse, like a heartbeat. That's it.

No product hero shot. No beauty lighting. Just a thing, on a person, doing its job.

**What it means:** The product exists. It's modest. It's there. If you blinked, you'd miss it — and that's by design. The best assistive technology is invisible.

**Camera:** Handheld, breathing. Intimate distance.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
Medium close-up of person's chest area, simple white cotton t-shirt, natural fabric texture. Small matte-finish tech pendant hanging at sternum level on thin dark cord. Pendant's small purple LED indicator in mid-pulse, soft glow. Natural side window light from left, nothing dramatic. Intimate, casual, almost accidentally framed. 35mm film, Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field softening fabric texture while pendant stays sharp. Warm skin-adjacent tones, subtle, understated. No face visible, cropped below collarbone. Film grain. 2.39:1. --ar 21:9 --s 500 --style raw
```

### Video Generation Prompt
```
Handheld medium shot of chest with pendant. Natural breathing movement. Pendant's purple LED pulses once — soft glow lasting 0.4 seconds then fades. Camera has slight handheld drift. 1 second duration, film grain, 24fps.
```

## 10 — THE FACE
**Time:** 0:13 – 0:16
**Music moment:** Vocal builds toward emotional peak — "another Friday night I've wasted..."

**Frame:** This is the shot. The camera slowly tilts up from chest level — we see the pendant receding below frame — and arrives at a face. A young person. Could be any ethnicity (cast intentionally). Their eyes are open, but there's something — maybe the iris color is unusual, maybe the gaze doesn't quite land on the lens, maybe there's a slight milkiness. It's subtle. You might not even register it consciously on first viewing.

What you DO register: they're smiling. Not a posed smile — a real one. The kind that starts in the corners of the mouth and takes a second to reach the eyes. Like someone just said something funny just off-camera, or like the sun just came out after rain.

The light on their face is Vermeer-esque — a single soft source from camera-left, creating gentle gradation from light to shadow across the face. Warm. Tender.

And then — this is crucial — they let out a small, real, slightly imperfect laugh. Not performed. Not pretty. The kind of laugh where you hear braces clicking or a snort or a breath-catch. REAL. The audio of this laugh bleeds over the music, mixing with it. This is the first human sound in the entire film.

The pendant is barely visible at the bottom edge of frame as the camera settles on the face.

**What it means:** Everything before this was beautiful objects and empty spaces. This is the first face. The first human sound. The first warmth. After 13 seconds of aesthetic distance, you suddenly feel something. That's the whole film — the gap between seeing and feeling, closed in one smile.

**Camera:** Slow tilt up from chest to face. Settles. Holds on the smile.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
Portrait of young person, early twenties, gentle expression transitioning into genuine warm smile, as if reacting to something funny said just off-camera. Eyes open with subtle quality suggesting visual impairment — very slight, not dramatized. Single soft Vermeer-like light source from camera-left creating gentle tonal gradation across face, warm and tender. Simple white t-shirt, thin cord of pendant visible at base of neck. 85mm portrait lens on 35mm Kodak Portra 400 film, f/2 shallow depth of field, background completely dissolved to warm abstract tone. Film grain prominent. The warmest, most human image in the sequence — everything before was beautiful objects, this is a person. 2.39:1. --ar 21:9 --s 800 --style raw
```

### Video Generation Prompt
```
Slow tilt up from chest level (pendant visible) to face. Camera moves at the pace of a deep breath. As frame reaches face, subject transitions from neutral to genuine smile — not performed, natural, slightly imperfect. A real small laugh — brief, with personality (braces, breath-catch, whatever is real). Light shifts slightly on face as they move with the laugh. Camera settles on face and holds. Shallow depth of field, film grain, 24fps. Duration 3 seconds. This is the emotional peak of the film.
```

## 11 — ENDCARD
**Time:** 0:16 – 0:17+
**Music moment:** Fading out with the end of the first phrase. Only the tail of the laugh remains, then wind, then silence.

**Frame:** Black screen (#0D0C10). The eyeOS logo icon fades in — small, centered, in brand purple (#7B50C2). Below it, in a clean monospace or Clash Display: **Unseen Vision.** — and below that, barely legible: **eyeos.tech**

No slogan. No call-to-action. No "Learn More." Just the name and the URL. The restraint IS the message.

Holds for 1-1.5 seconds. The laugh's echo fades. Wind. Done.

### Image Generation Prompt
```
Pure black background #0D0C10, centered small eyeOS logo icon in muted purple #7B50C2. Below: "Unseen Vision." in clean semi-bold sans-serif. Below that in smaller monospace: "eyeos.tech" — minimal, restrained, typographic. Subtle 35mm film grain overlay at 2% opacity. Nothing else. 2.39:1. --ar 21:9

- Hands through tall grass (record in any field)
- Rain on window glass (close microphone against pane)
- Vinyl surface noise and stylus landing
- Japanese school corridor ambience (find online SFX library — Artlist, Epidemic Sound)
- Braille page turning + finger sliding on embossed paper
- A genuine, unrehearsed laugh (this is the most important sound in the film)

# THE PURPLE THREAD

eyeOS purple (#7B50C2) appears in EVERY shot but as something FOUND, never DESIGNED:

| Shot | Purple Element |
|------|---------------|
| 01 — Water | Oil-slick iridescence on water surface |
| 02 — Sphinx | Pre-dawn purple band on horizon |
| 03 — Dollar | None (shot too fast) |
| 04 — Grass | Single thread in woven bracelet |
| 05 — Rain Window | Neon blur through glass, one purple sign |
| 06 — Vinyl | None (too fast) |
| 07 — Corridor | Purple wildflower in glass on windowsill |
| 08 — Braille | None (pure tactile shot) |
| 09 — Pendant | LED pulse |
| 10 — Face | None (the warmth IS the brand, color is unnecessary) |
| 11 — Endcard | Logo in brand purple |

This creates a subliminal rhythm: purple appears, disappears, appears, disappears — like a pulse, like the pendant's LED, like a heartbeat.

# AI VIDEO AGENT — ONE-SHOT PRODUCTION PROMPT

*Copy-paste the following as a single instruction to your video AI agent:*

---

```
PROJECT: eyeOS "Unseen Vision" Brand Film
DURATION: 17 seconds
MUSIC: "All My Friends" whitneytbh cover, 0:00 to 0:17 (first vocal phrase)
ASPECT RATIO: 2.39:1 (cinemascope letterbox)
FRAME RATE: 24fps
OVERALL STYLE: 35mm celluloid film aesthetic. Kodak Vision3 / Fuji Eterna color science. Heavy visible film grain throughout. No digital sharpness. Desaturated earth-tone palette (ochre, slate, driftwood) with subtle purple (#7B50C2) accents appearing naturally in scenes. Influenced by Tarkovsky (patience, water, texture), Kurosawa (tonal mastery, stillness vs movement), Terrence Malick (natural light, stolen moments, hands in nature). No text until endcard. No voiceover.

EDIT RHYTHM: Cuts sync to musical beats and vocal phrasing. Mix of held shots (2-3 seconds) and flash cuts (0.5 seconds) for rhythmic variation.

SEQUENCE:

[0:00-0:02] SHOT 1: Overhead looking down at dark still water. Single ripple expanding from off-center. Purple-blue oil-slick iridescence on surface. Static camera. Contemplative.

[0:02-0:03.5] SHOT 2: Wide shot of Great Sphinx from rear/side angle. Pre-dawn violet sky. Purple band on horizon. Dust floating. Eroded stone texture. Near-static, epic scale.

[0:03.5-0:04] SHOT 3: FLASH CUT. Extreme macro of Eye of Providence on worn dollar bill. Raking sidelight. Desaturated olive. 0.5 seconds.

[0:04-0:06] SHOT 4: Two hands trailing through tall backlit wild grass, golden hour. Fingers spread, grass bending. Thin bracelet with purple thread on one wrist. Handheld, Malick-style. Joyful, sensory.

[0:06-0:07.5] SHOT 5: Interior through rain-covered window at night. City lights as abstract bokeh through water droplets. Small circle wiped in condensation. Warm interior vs cool exterior color clash. Static camera.

[0:07.5-0:08] SHOT 6: FLASH CUT. Overhead spinning vinyl record. Grooves catching light. Motion blur. 0.5 seconds.

[0:08-0:10.5] SHOT 7: Long symmetrical shot down Japanese high school corridor. Afternoon sun through windows, geometric light on wood floor. Single figure in school uniform standing still at far end, backlit. Curtains billowing. Purple wildflower in glass on foreground windowsill. Kubrick composition, static camera.

[0:10.5-0:12] SHOT 8: Extreme macro of fingertip reading Braille. Low raking light casting shadows from dots. Finger moving slowly right. Intimate, clinical.

[0:12-0:13] SHOT 9: Brief medium shot of chest area, white t-shirt, tech pendant on cord. Purple LED pulses once. Handheld, casual. 1 second.

[0:13-0:16] SHOT 10: THE KEY SHOT. Slow tilt up from chest to face. Young person, genuine warm smile emerging. Subtle visual impairment in eyes (understated). Vermeer lighting. The first and only face in the film. A real, imperfect laugh breaks through the music. This is the emotional climax.

[0:16-0:17] SHOT 11: Black screen. eyeOS logo in purple (#7B50C2) fades in. "Unseen Vision." below. "eyeos.tech" in small monospace. Laugh echo fades to wind, then silence.

SOUND: Music track provided. Layer field recording foley under music: water droplet, wind, grass rustling, rain on glass, vinyl crackle, school corridor ambience, paper/Braille finger sounds. The laugh at 0:13-0:16 should break through the music mix — it's the first human sound in the film and the emotional pivot.

CRITICAL RULES:
- No text or titles until endcard
- No Chinese language
- Film grain on every frame
- Purple appears only as natural/organic elements, never as graphic design (until endcard)
- The laugh must sound REAL — unpolished, genuine, slightly imperfect
- No shot should look "clean" or "digital" — every frame should feel like celluloid
```

# HIDDEN DETAILS (for the obsessive rewatcher)

- The water ripple in Shot 01 and the expanding LED pulse in Shot 09 have the same radius-over-time ratio
- The cleared circle in the rain-window (Shot 05) is the exact shape/proportion of the pendant's camera lens
- The Braille text in Shot 08, if translated, reads "see" — but it's too close and too fast for anyone to actually decode it in real time
- The figure in the school corridor (Shot 07) has their right hand at their side in a position that could be holding a white cane — you can never be sure because of the backlight
- The purple wildflower in Shot 07 is a common Japanese weed (Torenia, aka "wishbone flower") — its Japanese folk name loosely translates to "seeing flower"
- The pendant in Shot 09 appears for exactly 1 second — less time than any other element in the film — because the best assistive tech doesn't demand your attention
- The subject's laugh in Shot 10 is the only non-musical sound produced by a human in the entire film — 13 seconds of beautiful silence, then one real human voice. That's the thesis.
